## 2. General notes

This document contains search strings for finding publications related to the **actions** in the SDG 12 targets and indicators ("action approach"; focus on precision, smaller result set). We also have a version which finds publications related to the topics in the SDG 12 targets and indicators ("topic approach"; focus on recall, larger result set), provided in the same repository as this file. For more explanation, see the Readme in this repository.

The definition of sustainable consumption and production according to the UNEP publication *ABC of SCP* (<a id="ABC">[UNEP, 2010](#f1)</a>) is:
> *The use of services and related products, which respond to basic needs and bring a better quality of life while minimising the use of natural resources and toxic
> materials as well as the emissions of waste and pollutants over the life cycle of the service or product so as not to jeopardise the needs of future generations*

In these phrases SDG 12 is interpreted to be about tools and policies for promoting sustainable production and consumption, about sustainable management and efficient use of natural resources, and about reducing food waste and waste in general as well as managing the life cycle of all wastes (chemical waste in particular) thus reducing pollution and harmful releases to humans and the environment. SDG 12 is about implementing e.g. circular economy approaches, reusing and recycling materials and resources, promoting sustainable public procurements, adopting sustainable practises and reporting on company level and implementing sustainability programs on national and regional level. It also addresses the globally uneven distribution of sustainable consumption and production patterns (with special attention on the developing countries), raising consumer awareness and developing monitoring methods for the impacts of sustainable development as well as removing incentives which encourige wasteful consumption. 

Sustainable consumption and production is about *promoting social and economic development within the carrying capacity of ecosystems by delinking economic growth and environmental degradation* (<a id="ABC">[UNEP, 2010](#f1)</a>). Thus, advancing social equity and reducing poverty are essential goals of sustainable consumption and production, as well as addressing climate and other ecological challenges . However, these terms are usually not included in our search queries, since we have focused the queries on the **means to achieve these goals**. Still, in many of the phrases terms `environmental*` `eco` and `green` are used as a variation of `sustainable` to broaden the scope towards e.g. environmentally friendly production, eco-friendly products or green consumption.

We were not quite sure about whether to interpret research about economically sustainable businesses or about Corporate social responsibility (CSR) as relevant to SDG 12 or not. But excluding them would in any case be challenging if not impossible, without losing many relevant results.  

Term `responsible` was initially included as a synonym/variant of sustainable. Even though also relevant articles were found by `responsib*` we decided to remove it from the *Sustainability string*: ("sustainab*" OR "environmental*" OR "ecological*" OR "eco" OR "green") in most of the targets (12.1, 12.6, 12.8 and 12.a) due to too many irrelevant results. Instead, we combine `responsible` with `tourism` and `consumption` since these combinations tend to bring quite a few relevant results. Still, even these combinations bring some noise (e.g. about responsible alcohol consumption).

## 3. Targets

### Target 12.1

> **12.1 Implement the 10‑Year Framework of Programmes on Sustainable Consumption and Production Patterns, all countries taking action, with developed countries taking the lead, taking into account the development and capabilities of developing countries**
> 
> 12.1.1 Number of countries developing, adopting or implementing policy instruments aimed at supporting the shift to sustainable consumption and production

This target is interpreted to cover research about implementing programmes and policies to advance sustainable consumption and production, according to the UN's 10-Year Framework of Programmes (10YFP). We interpret this target to be about all countries taking action, and have not included a phrase for supporting the development or capabilities of developing countries here. Target 12.a is specifically about this.

This phrase aims to find research about implementing/promoting programmes and policies on sustainable consumption and production. 

The specific programme areas `consumer information` `sustainable lifestyles and education` `sustainable public procurement` `sustainable buildings and construction` `sustainable tourism` `sustainable food systems` and the definitions of them are from the UN DESA publication *The 10 Year Framework of Programmes on Sustainable Consumption and Production Patterns (10YFP)* (<a id="UNDESA2014">[UN DESA, 2014](#f2)</a>). The concepts `resource efficiency` and `product lifecycle` are also mentioned int the 10YFP. Some concepts, even though not mentioned in the 10YFP, are included from the UNEP publication *ABC to SCP*, subtitled *Towards a 10-Year Framework of Programmes on Sustainable Consumption and Production* (<a id="ABC">[UNEP, 2010](#f1)</a>): `waste management` `cleaner production` `sustainable transport` `eco-labelling and certification` `sustainable marketing` `design for sustainability` `ecodesign` `environmentally sound technologies`.

Terms used for policy instruments are paralelled with programmes and were found e.g. from the indicator 12.1.1 metadata (<a id="UNstats2021">[UN Statistics division, 2021](#f2)</a>) https://unstats.un.org/sdgs/metadata/files/Metadata-12-01-01.pdf. 

Some of the terms used in this phrase are central to the focus of this target, but also so generally used that they bring results about research which is not relevant to the targets of SDG 12. For example `resource efficiency` is used in computing sciences, human resources management and when discussing health and social services. `Reuse of resources` can refer to e.g. reuse of data resources and `sustainable housing` can also be about e.g. affordable housing. Also term `green` even when combined the specific terms of the phrase brings results which mention green e.g. as a colour or a name of a person.

### Target 12.2

> **12.2 By 2030, achieve the sustainable management and efficient use of natural resources**
> 
> 12.2.1 Material footprint, material footprint per capita, and material footprint per GDP

> 12.2.2 Domestic material consumption, domestic material consumption per capita, and domestic material consumption per GDP

This target is interpreted to cover research about a) promoting sustainable management and use of natural resources, including sustainable food production and b) advancing efficient use of natural resources, with emphesis on efficient material use, including green technologies & design, circularity, footprint and lifecycle analysis. We interpret this target to also be about reducing the use of natural resources and conserving them, e.g. by advancing ecolabelling and environmental certifications.

#### Phrase 1

This phrase aims to find research about promoting sustainable management of natural resources, such as forests, oceans, land, water, minerals and fuels. A specific sentence for sustainable forest management, used in SDG 15 target 15.2, is included in the phrase. 

As the `fossil fuels` are also natural resources (nonrenewable) we considered including the sustainable use of them. After a discussion with a specialist, we decided not to include them in this phrase. Instead, phrase 4 searches for reducing the use of fossil fuels.  

Term `water` does not appear as a single standing term because e.g. "water use" is related to many phenomena which are not relevant to the SDG 12. 

The combination of `environmental` and `development` brings some irrelevant results about e.g. ecological community development under different natural environmental conditions. But this combination is also central for many relevant papers about this target, e.g. environmental land use development. We were unable to find a suitable sentence for excluding irrelevant results without losing many relevant ones.

The elements of the phrase are *action(promote) + sustainable+management + natural resources*.

#### Phrase 2

This phrase aims to find research about promoting sustainable food production. It is identical to the SDG 2 target 2.4 phrase 4. 

`ecoagricultur*` is a relatively specialist term for ecology and agriculture and considered narrow enough to use alone.

Other terms suggesting research about sustainable agriculture were combined with the agricultural terms. `agroecolog*` (agroecology, or the agroecological approach) is considered a relevant term for sustainable, being related to ecology and environmental stability as well as social and cultural dimensions (<a id="SFS">[One Planet network Sustainable Food Systems (SFS) Programme, 2020, p. 28](#f8)</a>). Other terms for practices/approaches that can be considered to contribute to "sustainable food production systems" were gathered from <a id="HLPE">[High Level Panel of Experts on Food Security and Nutrition (2019, Appendix 1 and p. 36)](#f14)</a>; some of these also are relevant for soil quality. Other terms from this source are included in other phrases: "sustainable intensification" is covered in phrase 1, "climate smart agriculture" in phrase 2. `organic` must be combined due to use in other contexts (e.g. soil organic matter, organic carbon).

The elements of the phrase are *(ecoagriculture + action) OR (food production systems + sustainability + action)*

#### Phrase 3

This phrase aims to find research about promoting efficient use of natural resources, including e.g. circular economy, recycling materials and material footprint analyses. It also searches for saving/conserving natural resources, eco-labelling and environmental certification included. 

By the indicators of this target, it was interpreted to urge to understand the material footprint of commodities. This is why we have not linked `material/product lifecycles` to natural resources, but left them to be found independently. Term `footprint analysis`, however, is linked with natural resources in order to exclude irrelevant results about e.g. analysis of human feet. The footprint/lifecycles sentence is in two parts to reduce noise which in other phrases about footprint/lifecycle analysis (12.1.1&2, 12.5.2, 12.8.2 and 12.a.1) is controlled by linkage to `sustainability`. Even still, `lifecycles` brings some irrelevant results about e.g. lifecycles of animals.  

After a discussion with a specialist we concluded that `circular economy` does not need to be combined with `natural resources` since (as far as we understand) circular economy is always about using (either renewable on nonrenewable) natural resources one way or another. Terms refering to `recycling` are linked to a set of related terms in order to exclude results from fields not relevant to SDG 12.


The elements of the phrase are *action(promote) + circularity/recycling/material lifecycles/ecolabelling OR efficient use/sustainable consumption/footprint + natural resources*

#### Phrase 4

This phrase aims to find research about reducing the use and exploitation of natural resources and fossil fuels and the waste involved in the use of them.

Some of the sources for natural resources (e.g. `marine` and `minerals`) are linked with terms `resources` or `materials` in order to reduce noise.


The elements of the phrase are *action(reduce) + material footprint / use/waste + natural resources/fossil fuels*

```
#### Phrase 5

This phrase aims to find research about resisting unsustainable/irresponsible/inefficient management and use of natural resources, such as forests, oceans, land, water, minerals or fuels. A specific sentence for sustainable forest management, used in SDG 15 target 15.2, is included in the phrase. 

Term `irresponsible` is not combined with the use of `fossil fuels` and `energy sources` in order to avoid irrelevant results.

Term `water` does not appeare as a single standing term because e.g. "water use" is related to many phenomena which are not relevant to the SDG 12. 

The elements of the phrase are *action(resist) + unsustainable use/practises + natural resources*.

### Target 12.3

> **12.3 By 2030, halve per capita global food waste at the retail and consumer levels and reduce food losses along production and supply chains, including post-harvest losses**
> 
> 12.3.1 (a) Food loss index and (b) food waste index

This target is interpreted to cover research about reducing food loss on all levels from food production, to supply chains, retail and consumer levels. We interpret it to also cover advaning capasity building for preventing food loss as mentioned in the FAO *Initiative on Food Loss and Waste Reduction* (<a id="FAO">[FAO Global Initiative on Food Loss](#f9)</a>). 

Although the target specifies levels where food loss happens (production, supply chains, retail, consumer) we have not restricted phrases 1 or 2 with these. It would narrow down the result because not all relevant articles about food loss mention any of those terms. Phrase 3 searches for preventing waste on specified levels of food production/retail/consumption. 

`food loss` or `food losses` are used as a fixed term in all phrases to avoid various irrelevant articles about animal nutrition and human health brought by `food` NEAR `loss`. Even still, the phrase returns some irrelevant articles about animal nutrition and human health. The irrelevant articles are found particularly from prior to 2015. The majority of articles contributing to the topics of this target are published after 2015. 


#### Phrase 1

This phrase aims to find research about reducing food loss and waste on all levels. Terms for food loss are mostly from the metadata for FAO indicator 12.3.1 (<a id="UNstats2021">[UN Statistics division, 2021](#f3)</a>) https://unstats.un.org/sdgs/metadata/files/Metadata-12-03-01A.pdf

Terms refering to `inedible parts` or `non-edible parts` were not included in the phrase - although they are mentioned in the metadata for UNEP 12.3.1 indicator  (<a id="UNstats2021">[UN Statistics division, 2021](#f3)</a>) https://unstats.un.org/sdgs/metadata/files/Metadata-12-03-01B.pdf. The terms brought irrelevant results about animal feeding choises and a majority of relevant results would have been found with the term `waste` which is included in the search phrase.

Terms `weight loss` and `obesity` are added in the phrase with `NOT` to exclude irrelevant results about food & weight loss, as well as `insecurity` to exclude articles about food insecurity (loss of lives close to "food") and `food intake` and `body weight` to exclude articles about animal nutrition. 

The elements of the phrase are *action(reduce) + food loss*

)

```

#### Phrase 2

This phrase aims to find research about instruments involved in food waste. The instruments included are mentioned as pillars of FAO *Global Initiative on Food Loss and Waste Reduction* (<a id="FAO">[FAO Global Initiative on Food Loss](#f9)</a>). 

The instruments are combined to food loss, but not to reducing it, i.e. this phrase has no action terms. We assume that articles about the instruments combined with food loss are relevant to reducing food waste.

Terms `weight loss` and `obesity` are added in the phrase with `NOT` to exclude irrelevant results about food & weight loss, as well as `insecurity` to exclude articles about food insecurity (loss of lives close to "food") and `food intake` and `body weight` to exclude articles about animal nutrition.

#### Phrase 3

This phrase aims to find research about preventing waste in food production/processing/supply chains/retail/consumption. 

The metadata for FAO indicator 12.3.1 (<a id="UNstats2021">[UN Statistics division, 2021](#f3)</a>) https://unstats.un.org/sdgs/metadata/files/Metadata-12-03-01A.pdf was used to find most of the specifying terms for food commodities and levels of handling food (harvest, slaughter, storage, transportation, processing, packaging, retail). Terms for food handling were found also from UNEP *Global Chemicals and Waste Indicator Review Document* (<a id="UNEPchemicals">[UNEP, 2021](#f11)</a>).

Terms `weight loss` and `obesity` are added in the phrase with `NOT` to exclude irrelevant results about food & weight loss, as well as `insecurity` to exclude articles about food insecurity (loss of lives close to "food") and `food intake` and `body weight` to exclude articles about animal nutrition.

### Target 12.4

> **12.4 By 2020, achieve the environmentally sound management of chemicals and all wastes throughout their life cycle, in accordance with agreed international frameworks, and significantly reduce their release to air, water and soil in order to minimize their adverse impacts on human health and the environment**
> 
> 12.4.1 Number of parties to international multilateral environmental agreements on hazardous waste, and other chemicals that meet their commitments and obligations in transmitting information as required by each relevant agreement

> 12.4.2 (a) Hazardous waste generated per capita; and (b) proportion of hazardous waste treated, by type of treatment

This target is interpreted to cover research about promoting a) sustainable/environmentally sound management of chemicals thoughout their life cycle, and about research which promotes international agreements about chemical management. The target also covers b) advancing sustainable management of all wastes and c) reducing their release to air, water and soil, as well as research which promotes international agreements on management of hazardous wastes. 

UN topic page for *Chemicals and waste* (<a id="chemicals">[UN Topics Chemicals and waste](#f10)</a>) and UNEP *Global Chemicals and Waste Indicator Review Document* (<a id="UNEPchemicals">[UNEP, 2021, p. 65](#f11)</a>) as well as *Basel Convention Annex VIII* (<a id="UNEPBasel">[UNEP Basel Convention](#f12)</a>) and UNEP webpage *Persistent Organic Pollutants (POPs) and Pesticides* (<a id="UNEPPOPs">[UNEP POPs](#f17)</a>) were used as a source for terms and definitions. Some chemicals were also found from the Finnish Food Authority Chemical webpages https://www.ruokavirasto.fi/en/themes/risk-assessment/risk-assessment-of-food-safety/chemistry/. The indicators for 12.4 emphesise hazardous wastes and chemicals. For this reason the focus is on terms for hazardous chemicals (e.g. POPs) and household wastes (paints, polish, cleaning products, engine oil).

Some specifying terms for wastes were found from the UN topic page for *Chemicals and waste* (<a id="chemicals">[UN Topics Chemicals and waste](#f10)</a>) and specifying terms for waste management from the UNEP *Global Chemicals and Waste Indicator Review Document* (<a id="UNEPchemicals">[UNEP, 2021](#f11)</a>).


#### Phrase 1

The aim of this phrase is to find research about promoting sustainable management of chemicals thoughout their lifecycle, and about research promoting international agreements on chemical management. 

International agreements included in the phrase are mentioned on the UN topic page for *Chemicals and waste* (<a id="chemicals">[UN Topics Chemicals and waste](#f10)</a>).

#### Phrase 2

The aim of this phrase is to find research about advancing sustainable waste management including recycling, and about research promoting international agreements on hazardous wastes mentioned in the metadata for indicator 12.4.1. (<a id="UNstats2021">[UN Statistics division, 2021](#f3)</a>) https://unstats.un.org/sdgs/metadata/files/Metadata-12-04-01.pdf. 

`Recycling` terms are not restricted by sustainability string since recycling is understood as sustainable waste management in itself. According to metadata for indicator 12.5.1 (<a id="UNstats2021">[UN Statistics division, 2021](#f3)</a>) https://unstats.un.org/sdgs/metadata/files/Metadata-12-05-01.pdf `composting` and `codigestion` are included in recycling, but `combustion`not. The structure of this phrase reflects this definition.

### Target 12.5

> **12.5 By 2030, substantially reduce waste generation through prevention, reduction, recycling and reuse**
> 
> 12.5.1 National recycling rate, tons of material recycled

This target is interpreted to cover research about reducing household, municipal and industrial waste generation and about promoting recycling. We interpret promoting circular economy and using sidestreams to be included in in this target. As defined in the metadata for indicator 12.5.1 (<a id="UNstats2021">[UN Statistics division, 2021](#f3)</a>) https://unstats.un.org/sdgs/metadata/files/Metadata-12-05-01.pdf  `construction waste` and `agricultural waste` are not included in the phrases of this target. Some specifying terms for waste generators are picked from the indicator 12.5.1.

The themes of this target are also addressed in target **12.2 phrases 3 and 4** about efficient use of natural resources and reducing waste involved in using them, as well as in target **12.3 phrases 1 and 3** about reducing food loss and waste in food production. Promoting recycling of wastes is also included in target **12.4 phrase 2**.

#### Phrase 1

This phrase aims to find research about reducing household, municipal and industrial waste.

The elements of the phrase are *action(reduce) + wastes + generation/households/municipal/industry*

      )
)

```

#### Phrase 2

This phrase aims to find research about promoting recycling, reuse, circular economy and utilizing sidestreams.

Because terms `recycle` `reuse` and `resource efficiency` have various meanings in fields irrelevant to this target, they are combined with a string of terms related to the target: *bioeconomy/production/consumption/materials/waste*. Unfortunately, limiting `recycling` like this leaves out many relevant papers which do not mention these terms but talk on a more specific level (e.g. recycling bottles, paper, etc.). And even with the limitation, some irrelevant papers about e.g. electronics and cell biology are still found by this phrase. 

Term `compost` is removed from the phrase to focus on articles about reducing waste instead of articles about composting in general. Promoting circular use of natural resources, including composting, is covered by target 12.2 phrase 3.

The elements of the phrase are *action(promote) + recycling/reuse/circular economy/using sidestreams*

### Target 12.6

> **12.6 Encourage companies, especially large and transnational companies, to adopt sustainable practices and to integrate sustainability information into their reporting cycle**
> 
> 12.6.1 Number of companies publishing sustainability reports

This target is interpreted to cover research about encouraging companies to a) adopt sustainable practices and sustainable production in general, and to b) report their sustainability information. 

The phrases search for companies of all sizes, i.e. they are not focused to large ones even though the target emphesises them. Term `producers` is used as a synonym to companies/firms in order to broaden the search. It does, however, also bring some irrelevant results about e.g. ecological research.   

The concept of economical sustainability is used broadly and in some cases we found it hard to interpret which papers about financial sustainability are relevant to target 12.6. 


#### Phrase 1

This phrase aims to find research about encouraging companies to adopt sustainable practices as well as sustainable production patterns and measures. 

The practices are mentioned in the metadata for indicator 12.6.1 (<a id="UNstats2021">[UN Statistics division, 2021](#f3)</a>) https://unstats.un.org/sdgs/metadata/files/Metadata-12-06-01.pdf (e.g. `procurements` `sourcing`). 

Terms for sustainable production and its elements e.g. `sustainable buildings and construction` and `product lifecycle` were found from the UN DESA publication *The 10 Year Framework of Programmes on Sustainable Consumption and Production Patterns (10YFP)* (<a id="UNDESA2014">[UN DESA, 2014](#f2)</a>). Some concepts are from the UNEP publication *ABC to SCP* subtitled *Towards a 10-Year Framework of Programmes on Sustainable Consumption and Production* (<a id="ABC">[UNEP, 2010](#f1)</a>): `cleaner production` `sustainable transport` `eco-labelling and certification` `sustainable marketing` `design for sustainability` `ecodesign` `environmentally sound technologies`.

### Target 12.7

> **12.7 Promote public procurement practices that are sustainable, in accordance with national policies and priorities**
> 
> 12.7.1 Degree of sustainable public procurement policies and action plan implementation

This target is interpreted to cover research about promoting a) national policies and actions plans for sustainable procurements and b) the implementation of them (<a id="UNEPSPP">[UNEP, 2022](#f13)</a>), i.e. promoting sustainable public procurements.

This phrase aims to find research about promoting/developing national practices/policies for sustainable procurements. Some of the terms used as variations of practices/policies are from UNEP *One planet SSP Index Calculation Methodology* (<a id="UNEPSPP">[UNEP, 2022](#f13)</a>). 

Terms `fair trade` `human rights` `employment of minorities` `Best value for Money` `Life-cycle costing`and `Most Economically Advantageous Tender` are mentioned as concepts of sustainable procurements in the metadata for indicator 12.7.1 (<a id="UNstats2021">[UN Statistics division, 2021](#f3)</a>) https://unstats.un.org/sdgs/metadata/files/Metadata-12-07-01.pdf.

Terms `sustainable` `responsible` and `investments` are used in many fields, and bring some irrelevant results about e.g. sustainable investements/procurements in health care. These have not been excluded as the exclusion of them would not be possible without losing many articles relevant to the topics of target 12.7.

### Target 12.8

> **12.8 By 2030, ensure that people everywhere have the relevant information and awareness for sustainable development and lifestyles in harmony with nature**
> 
> 12.8.1 Extent to which (i) global citizenship education and (ii) education for sustainable development are mainstreamed in (a) national education policies; (b) curricula; (c) teacher education; and (d) student assessment

This target is interpreted to cover research about advacing dissimination of information, education and awareness raising on sustainable development. The indicator for this target is a shared indicator with **target 4.7** and **13.3**. However the phrases for 12.8 are more focused on environmental sustainability to reflect the mentioning of "lifestyles in harmony with nature" in the target. "Lifestyles in harmony with nature" is not incorporated in the phrase as a term, to focus on the means to achive this goal.

By the definition in the UNEP publication *ABC of SDP* (<a id="ABC">[UNEP, 2010](#f1)</a>) "*Education for Sustainable Development (ESD) concerns all levels of education and all social contexts (family, school, workplace, community)*". For this reason, phrase 1 is focused on all dissemination of information and not restricted to only formal education.

We interpret this target to be also about promoting sustainable consumer behavior and added phrase 2 for finding research about this, i.e. promoting sustainable consumption and choices. 


#### Phrase 1

This phrase aims to find research about promoting dissimination of information, education and awareness raising on sustainable development, including consumer education. 

Term `education` by itself brings many results which are irrelevant to this target. To remove these `education`  is combined with `consumers` or `citizens`. 

Term `responsiblity` is used only as combined with consumer choises in order to reduce noise. Still, practically all terms for disseminating information/raising awareness/teaching/learning combined with sustainability/environmental/enviroment tend to bring irrelevant results about e.g. learning environment or health education. These are hard to exclud from the results without losing the core of relevant results.

The elements of the phrase are *action(promote) + dissimination of information + sustainability*

### Target 12.a

> **12.a Support developing countries to strengthen their scientific and technological capacity to move towards more sustainable patterns of consumption and production**
> 
> 12.a.1 Installed renewable energy-generating capacity in developing countries (in watts per capita)


This target is interpreted to cover research about promoting the scientific and technological capabilities of developing countries regarding sustainable consumption and production patterns. By the indicator of this target, special interest is understood to be on the capacities related to renewable energy sources.


#### Phrase 1

This phrase aims to find research about promoting the scientific and technological capabilites (including finance and incentives) of developing countries regarding sustainable consumption and production patterns.

The specific programme areas `consumer information` `sustainable lifestyles and education` `sustainable public procurement` `sustainable buildings and construction` `sustainable tourism` `sustainable food systems` and the definitions of them are from the UN DESA publication *The 10 Year Framework of Programmes on Sustainable Consumption and Production Patterns (10YFP)* (<a id="UNDESA2014">[UN DESA, 2014](#f2)</a>). The concepts `resource efficiency` and `product lifecycle` are also mentioned int the 10YFP. Some concepts, even though not mentioned in the 10YFP, are included from the UNEP publication *ABC to SCP*, subtitled *Towards a 10-Year Framework of Programmes on Sustainable Consumption and Production* (<a id="ABC">[UNEP, 2010](#f1)</a>): `waste management` `cleaner production` `sustainable transport` `eco-labelling and certification` `sustainable marketing` `design for sustainability` `ecodesign` `environmentally sound technologies`.

Our classification of countries as least developed countries (LDCs), small island developing states (SIDS) and landlocked developing states (LDS) is taken from the Statistical Annex of United Nations World Economic Situation and Prospects (tables F, H and I) (<a id="UNLDCs">[United Nations, 2016, 2017, 2018, 2019, 2020, 2021](#f4)</a>). Additional terms for these countries, generic terms for country groups, and terms for low and middle income countries (LMICs) were gathered from the LMIC 2020 filter from the Norwegian Satellite of Cochrane Effective Practice and Organisation of Care (EPOC), developed by the Norwegian Institute of Public Heath (https://epoc.cochrane.org/lmic-filters).

The elements of the phrase are *action(develop) + capacity/scientific/technical/skills + sustainable consumption & production + developing countries*

### Target 12.b

> **12.b Develop and implement tools to monitor sustainable development impacts for sustainable tourism that creates jobs and promotes local culture and products**
> 
> 12.b.1 Implementation of standard accounting tools to monitor the economic and environmental aspects of tourism sustainability

This target is interpreted to cover research about developing monitoring of the economic, social and environmental impacts of sustainable tourism. Creating jobs and promoting local cultures and products are interpreted as impacts of sustainable tourism. 

The definition of sustainable tourism according to UNWTO *Sustainable Tourism for Development Guidebook* (<a id="UNWTO">[UNWTO, 2013](#f14)</a>) is:
> *“Tourism that takes full account of its current and future economic, social and environmental impacts, addressing the needs of visitors, the industry, the environment, and host communities”*. 

This phrase aims to find research about developing monitoring of the impacts of sustainable tourism. Impacts include economic, social and environmental impacts. Some specifying terms for these were found from the UNWTO guidebook (<a id="UNWTO">[UNWTO, 2013](#f14)</a>). 

The elements of the phrase are *action(develop) + monitoring/regulating/accounting + impacts + sustainable+tourism*

### Target 12.c

> **12.c Rationalize inefficient fossil-fuel subsidies that encourage wasteful consumption by removing market distortions, in accordance with national circumstances, including by restructuring taxation and phasing out those harmful subsidies, where they exist, to reflect their environmental impacts, taking fully into account the specific needs and conditions of developing countries and minimizing the possible adverse impacts on their development in a manner that protects the poor and the affected communities**
> 
> 12.c.1 Amount of fossil-fuel subsidies (production and consumption) per unit of GDP

This target is interpreted to cover research about rationalizing/removing subsidies from the production and consumption of fossil fuels, and about restructuring/improving taxation of the production and consumption of fossil fuels. Developing countries are not specified as rationalizing subsidies and restructuring taxation of the use of fossil fuels is interpreted to address all countries. 

UNEP report *Measuring Fossil Fuel Subsidies in the Context of the Sustainable Development Goals* (<a id="UNEPfossil">[UNEP, 2019](#f16)</a>) is used for definitions of fossil fuels and subsidies. According to the UNEP report fossils fuels do not include nuclear fuel, renewable energy and biofuels. The report recommends including also non-energy uses of fossil fuels (e.g. use for production of plastic) in the scope of SDG (p. 14). For this reason the phrases are built to search for any use of fossil fuels. 

Both production and consumption of fossil fuels are included in the phrases as both are mentioned in the metadata for indicator 12.c.1 (<a id="UNstats2021">[UN Statistics division, 2021](#f3)</a>) https://unstats.un.org/sdgs/metadata/files/Metadata-12-0c-01.pdf.

#### Phrase 1

This phrase aims to find research about rationalizing/removing subsidies from the production and consumption of fossil fuels. 

Most of the terms for subsidies were found from the UNEP report *Measuring Fossil Fuel Subsidies in the Context of the Sustainable Development Goals* (<a id="UNEPfossil">[UNEP, 2019](#f16)</a>) table 6 p. 19 - and for fossil fuels from table 5 p. 13.

The elements of the phrase are *action(rationalize) + subsidies + fossil fuels*

      )
)
```

#### Phrase 2

This phrase aims to find research about restructuring/improving the taxation of fossil fuels production and consumption.

The elements of the phrase are *action(restructure) + taxation + fossil fuels*


```py
TS=
(
  ("restructur*" OR "reform*" OR "rationali?e$" OR "rationali?ing" OR "transition*" OR "transform*" OR "renew*")
