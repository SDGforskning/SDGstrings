## 2. General notes

This document contains search strings for finding publications related to the **topics** in SDG 15 targets and indicators ("topic approach"; focus on recall, larger result set). We also have a version which finds publications related to the actions in SDG 15 targets and indicators ("action approach"; focus on precision, smaller result set), provided in the same repository as this file. For more explanation, see the Readme in this repository.

SDG 15 is interpreted to be about ending environmental decline of terrestrial and inland freshwater ecosystems and restoring them. Special emphasis is on forests and the sustainable management of them, on wetlands, mountains and drylands, halting land degradation and desertification, protecting biodiversity, preventing the extinction of threatened species and the spreading of invasive alien species, as well as preventing wildlife trafficking. The consequences of ecosystem degradation and wildlife trafficking on human survival and well-being (e.g. spreading of zoonotic diseases) is included in UN SDG reports (<a id="Life2020">[SDG 15 Life on land](#f17)</a>; https://unstats.un.org/sdgs/report/2020/goal-15/; <a id="Life2021">[SDG 15 Life on land](#f18)</a>; https://unstats.un.org/sdgs/report/2021/goal-15/), but not specified in the targets.

Targets and Indicators were found from the UN Statistics Division (<a id="SDGT+Is">[UN Statistics Division, 2021](#f1)</a>). This list includes "the global indicator framework as contained in A/RES/71/313, the refinements agreed by the Statistical Commission at its 49th session in March 2018 (E/CN.3/2018/2, Annex II) and 50th session in March 2019 (E/CN.3/2019/2, Annex II), changes from the 2020 Comprehensive Review (E/CN.3/2020/2, Annex II) and refinements (E/CN.3/2020/2, Annex III) from the 51st session in March 2020, and refinements from the 52nd session in March 2021 (E/CN.3/2021/2, Annex)".

### What is life on *land*?

The attempt to limit the results to terrestrial and freshwater environments only (as opposed to marine) is made by combining the search strings with terrestrial and freshwater terms. However:

* In principle, the division between freshwater and marine is somewhat artificial for some species (e.g. migratory fish) or aquatic ecosystems; some habitats may span the marine and terrestrial environments (e.g. mangroves). These works should not be excluded.
* On a practical level, some habitats pose particular challenges for separating freshwater from marine, e.g. term `meadow` retrieves also articles about "seagrass meadows", `forests` about "kelp forests", and `coasts` can be marine coastal areas but also river delta coastal areas. 

We therefore attempt to limit to terrestrial or freshwater works, without being overly strict. This is mostly achieved by using two methods of combining the strings with terrestrial and freshwater terms - either directly with `AND` (works must mention a terrestrial term) or indirectly with `NOT marine` (which removes works mentioning marine terms unless a terrestrial term is also mentioned). See **Terrestrial and freshwater terms** below.

## 3. Terrestrial and freshwater terms: String for limiting certain phrases to the terrestrial and freshwater environment

This string is referred to as **terrestrial and freshwater terms** and is used in many of the strings below to limit the results to terrestrial and freshwater environment.

In some phrases, these terms are combined to the string with `AND` while in others a double `NOT` is used (`NOT marine NOT terrestrial/freshwater`). 
- Phrases which consist of more general terms are more likely to return results about topics irrelevant to the targets of SDG15 or natural environments, so these were combined with terrestrial/freshwater terms with `AND` to focus only on works which mention one of the terrestrial or freshwater terms. 
- Phrases which contain more specific ecological terms are more likely to already be focused on works about either marine, terrestrial or freshwater habitats/organisms, and only the pure marine works need to be excluded. `NOT marine NOT terrestrial/freshwater` was used for these as it excludes works using marine terms *unless* they also contain one of the terrestrial of freshwater terms. This "double NOT" strategy is commonly employed in the medical sciences to find human studies and exclude animal studies, while ensuring that animal studies are still included if they *also* mention humans. We use this strategy when possible as it has slightly better recall - for example, a work may be about a species of grass, but not use generic terms for terrestrial habitats - this work would likely be caught by the double `NOT` strategy, but be missed by the `AND` strategy. 

According to the SDG indicators metadata description for indicator 15.1.1 (<a id="SDGmetarep">[UN Statistics Division 2022](#f3)</a>; https://unstats.un.org/sdgs/metadata/files/Metadata-15-01-01.pdf) *mangroves* in tidal zones are included in forests regardless of whether this area is classified as land area or not, and are therefore included in our definition of "life on land".

Although mentioned in the definition for inland waters in the SDG indicator metadata for indicator 15.1.1 (<a id="SDGmetarep">[UN Statistics Division 2022](#f3)</a>; https://unstats.un.org/sdgs/metadata/files/Metadata-15-01-01.pdf), the terms `reservoirs` `canals` `dams` are not included in the string. Combined with management and water, they would be likely to bring many irrelevant results on water supply management etc.

Terms `land` and `fields` were initially in the phrase, but were removed to exclude many irrelevant results due to the broad meaning and use of these terms (e.g. scientific fields, magnetic field, Netherlands, England). `fells` are combined with Lapland because independently they brought a lot of noise (*fell* has many other meanings). Initially they were also combined with Scotland, but due to many irrelevant results, Scotland was left out. `heathland$` and `moorland$` are used rather than "heath" and "moor" because these words lead to a lot of irrelevant results (due to being names, typos in "health", historical groups).

## 4. Targets

### Target 15.1

> **15.1 By 2020, ensure the conservation, restoration and sustainable use of terrestrial and inland freshwater ecosystems and their services,
> in particular forests, wetlands, mountains and drylands, in line with obligations under international agreements**
>
> 15.1.1 Forest area as a proportion of total land area
>
> 15.1.2 Proportion of important sites for terrestrial and freshwater biodiversity that are covered by protected areas, by ecosystem type

This target is interpreted to cover research about a) conservation of terrestrial and inland freshwater ecosystems, b) restoring these ecosystems and c) using these ecosystems and their services sustainably. Sustainable management is understood to be a part of sustainable use. The action approach versions of these phrases are directed more towards promoting/implementing/increasing the conservation(++) of ecosystems, whereas the aim of the topic approach versions is towards any works about conservation(++) of ecosystems. 

Even though forests, wetlands, mountains and drylands are highlighted in the target description, they are not specified in the phrases since they are already included in the **Terrestrial and freshwater terms**, which are combined with all the phrases of this target either directly with `AND` or indirectly with `NOT marine` unless a terrestrial or freshwater habitat is mentioned.

This query consists of 5 phrases. 
* Phrases 1 and 2 cover protecting and restoring habitats and ecosystems. The phrases are similar, but differ in how strictly they are connected to **terrestrial or freshwater terms**. 
* Phrase 3 also covers research about protecting and restoring, but adds elements of management, for ecosystems, communities and biodiversity. 
* Phrase 4 covers sustainable management approaches for ecosystems and their services
* Phrase 5 aims to find research specifically related to the international agreements on conservation/restoration of terrestrial and freshwater ecosystems.

#### Phrase 1

This phrase aims to find research outputs about the protection of habitats and biotopes, and protected areas. 

The elements of the phrase are *protected areas/conservation/restoration + habitats*. It is limited by the exclusion of `marine` habitats (except when a **terrestrial or freshwater term** is mentioned) and some other terms which lead to irrelevant results. Phrase 1 searches for protection of habitats limited only by the exclusion of marine habitats. Phrase 2 searches for conservation of ecosystems and more specific habitats. It is restricted more strictly to terrestrial habitats to exclude irrelevant results associated with the use of terms (e.g. `ecosystem`) on research areas other than natural sciences. 

While testing the phrases it was noticed that marine papers mentioning `seagrass meadows` will appear in the results for phrases 1 & 2 despite of the `NOT marine` string. They are brought by the term `meadow` in the terrestrial string. Irrelevant results are brought also by terms like `lake` and `river` when they appear in names of places.

```

#### Phrase 2

This phrase aims to find research outputs about protecting ecosystems and specific habitats.

The elements of the phrase are *conservation/restoration + ecosystems/areas*. In order to specify to the terrestrial and freshwater ecosystems the phrase is combined with **Terrestrial and freshwater terms** with `AND`. Phrase 1 searches for protection of habitats limited only by the exclusion of marine habitats. Phrase 2 searches for conservation of ecosystems and more specific habitats. It is restricted more strictly to terrestrial habitats to exclude irrelevant results associated with the use of terms (e.g. `ecosystem`) on research areas other than natural sciences. 

While testing the phrases it was noticed that marine papers mentioning `seagrass meadows` will appear in the results for phrases 1 & 2 despite of the `NOT marine` string. They are brought by the term `meadow` in the terrestrial string. Irrelevant results are brought also by terms like `lake` and `river` when they appear in names of places.

```

#### Phrase 3

This phrase aims to find research about managing, protecting and restoring terrestrial and freshwater ecosystems, communities and biodiversity. 

Compared to the action approach version, this phrase has been edited to topic approach only partly. The topic here is understood to be not just ecosystems but more specifically the conservation of ecosystem. This is why the phrase has been edited only by lifting the action terms which limit the management/conservation/protection etc. string.

Under the ecosystems/elements, we include diversity at various levels (important for ecosystem functioning, resilience and services), key species and foundation species.

As the use of term `ecosystem` by others than natural sciences brings irrelevant results, it was combined with terms refering to species and habitats.

The elements of this phrase are *conservation/restoration + ecosystems/diversity*. It is limited by the exclusion of `marine` habitats (except when a **terrestrial or freshwater term** is mentioned) and some other terms which were detected to bring irrelevant results. Terms about human microbiome and terms which are related to diseases were added to `double NOT` string in order to exclude articles about those. The medical terms were picked from a set of irrelevant papers found when testing the phrases and are not chosen systematically. It is possible that terms like `parasite` `infection` or `immunology` will exclude also relevant results.

```

#### Phrase 4

This phrase aims to retrieve research about the sustainable use of terrestrial and freshwater ecosystems and their services. For better recall, some ecosystem services are specified, most of these found from the UN HLPF Background note for SDG 15 (<a>[UN-DESA/DSDG et al. 2018](#f4)</a>), UN topic page for Forests (<a id="forests">[UN DESA n.d.a](#f5)</a>) and SDG indicator metadata for indicator 15.3.1 (<a id="SDGmetarep">[UN Statistics Division 2022](#f3)</a>; https://unstats.un.org/sdgs/metadata/files/Metadata-15-03-01.pdf).

The elements of this phrase are *sustainable use approaches OR sustainable use + ecosystems/ecosystem services*. It is limited by the exclusion of `marine` habitats (except when a **terrestrial or freshwater term** is mentioned) and some other terms which were detected to bring irrelevant results. 

The acronym `KBA` (for key biodiversity area) was removed as it only causes noise.

Some ecosystem services mentioned in indicator 15.3.1 metadata were not included in the phrase because they would be likely to return many results which are not relevant to the SDG 15:
* Cultural heritage
* Regional climate regulation
* Climate change mitigation
* Disaster risk reduction (flood, drought, soil erosion)
* Regulation of pests and diseases
* Water regulation
* Pollination
* Medicinal resources
* Primary production
* Nutrient cycling
* Water cycling
* Soil formation

```

#### Phrase 5

This phrase aims to find research about the conservation/restoration of terrestrial and freshwater ecosystems specifically in relation to the international agreements or actions. Most of the agreements and treaties included by name are mentioned in the UN HLPF Background note SDG 15 (<a>[UN-DESA/DSDG et al. 2018](#f4)</a>). Two agreements concerning the use of genetic resources are included (*Nagoya Protocol* and *The Treaty on Plant Genetic Resources for Food and Agriculture*) assuming that mentioning these agreements in the context of terrestrial of freshwater terms implies actions towards the targets of SDG 15.1.

The elements of this phrase are *international agreements/instruments*. It is limited by the exclusion of `marine` habitats (except when a **terrestrial or freshwater term** is mentioned) and some other terms which were detected to bring irrelevant results. The term `CITES` is combined to a string of species terms (including particularly susceptable species from UN's World Wildlife Crime Report; <a id="wwc">[UNODC, 2020](#f13)</a>) in order to exclude irrelevant articles which use cite as a verb. The UN Convention on climate change `UNFCCC` is combined to a string of ecosystem terms to specify to conserving ecosystems (rather than reducing emissions in general).

### Target 15.2

> **15.2 By 2020, promote the implementation of sustainable management of all types of forests, halt deforestation, restore degraded forests and substantially increase afforestation and reforestation globally**
>
> 15.2.1 Progress towards sustainable forest management

This target is interpreted to cover research about sustainable forest management, deforestation, and research which contributes to increasing forest covered land area globally. `Silvicultures` are included in the phrases because the SDG indicator metadata for indicator 15.1.1 (<a id="SDGmetarep">[UN Statistics Division 2022](#f3)</a>; https://unstats.un.org/sdgs/metadata/files/Metadata-15-01-01.pdf) does not limit forests to just natural ones. However including `arboricultures` is more debatable, by the indicators definition agricultural production systems (e.g. fruit tree or oil palm plantations) should not be included as forest for SDG 15. A machine learning algorithm "Random forests" brings irrelevant results not related to forests. Excluding these is not possible without missing relevant papers since "Random forests" can be applied also in forest research.

Specific forest management terms (methods, etc.) were found mainly from FAOâs Agrovoc thesaurus (<a id="agrovoc">[FAO, n.d.](#f15)</a>) and from a search query prepared in an earlier project for capturing forestry literature (<a id="stateforest">[PÃ¤ivinen et al. (2021); International Status of Finnish Forest Research, Tapio research](#f16)</a>). 

This query consists of 3 phrases.

### Target 15.3

> **15.3 By 2030, combat desertification, restore degraded land and soil, including land affected by desertification, drought and floods, and strive to achieve a land degradation-neutral world**
>
> 15.3.1 Proportion of land that is degraded over total land area

This target is interpreted to cover research about:
- desertifiction (phrase 1)
- land and soil quality in connection with floods, desertification and drought (phrase 2)
- land and soil degredation (phrase 3)
- land degradation neutrality (LDN) and maintenance of soil health (phrase 4) 

Definitions according to the SDG indicator metadata for indicator 15.3.1 (<a id="SDGmetarep">[UN Statistics Division 2022](#f3)</a>; https://unstats.un.org/sdgs/metadata/files/Metadata-15-03-01.pdf):
> "Land degradation is defined as the reduction or loss of the biological or economic productivity and complexity of rain fed cropland, irrigated cropland, or range, pasture, forest and woodlands resulting from a combination of pressures, including land use and management practices."

> "Land Degradation Neutrality (LDN) is defined as a state whereby the amount and quality of land resources necessary to support ecosystem functions and services and enhance food security remain stable or increase within specified temporal and spatial scales and ecosystems (decision 3/COP12)"

Given these definitions, we interpret the target to include research about all types of land (not just lands affected by desertification, drought or flooding). This means that these strings may pick up some works about soil erosion in built-up areas as well as "natural" areas. 

Sources used for definitions and specifying terms include: 
* 2018 UN HLPF Background note for SDG 15 (<a>[UN-DESA/DSDG et al. 2018](#f4)</a>) 
* CBD web pages for Dry and Sub-humid Lands (<a id="drylands">[CBD, Jun 2022](#f8)</a>)
* UN topic page for Desertification, Land degradation and Drought (<a id="desertification">[CBD, Jun 2022](#f6)</a>)

This query consists of 4 phrases. 

#### Phrase 1

This phrase aims to find research about desertification. The elements of the phrase are *desertification/UN agreements to combat desertification*.

```py
TS=
(
  "desertif*"
  OR (("increas*" OR "expan*") NEAR/5 ("desert$" OR "dryland$"))
  OR "United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification"
  OR "UN Convention to Combat Desertification"
  OR "UNCCD"
)
```

#### Phrase 2

This phrase aims to find research about land/soil quality connected to desertification, drought or floods. The elements of the phrase are *desertification/drought/flood + land or soil quality*.

In addition to articles about the effects agriforestry has on soils, this phrase also returns some articles about the effect of soil quality on agricultural productivity. These may still be concidered relevant to the target, since LDN by definition covers also land resources necessary for enhancing food security.

```py
TS=
(
  ("desert$" OR "desertif*" OR "drought$" OR "flood*" OR "dryland$")
  NEAR/15 ("soil structure" OR "soil fertility" OR "land fertility" OR "soil health" OR "soil productivity" OR "soil quality")
)
```

#### Phrase 3

This phrase aims to find research about land degradation processes and effects. The elements of the phrase are *land degradation processes // effects of land degradation + land/soil*.

The terms for degradation processes are picked mainly from the SDG indicator metadata description for 15.3.1 (<a id="SDGmetarep">[UN Statistics Division 2022](#f3)</a>; https://unstats.un.org/sdgs/metadata/files/Metadata-15-03-01.pdf). Note that this phrase also finds a number of results about groundwater changes - we consider this as a part of land/soil health.

### Target 15.4

> **15.4 By 2030, ensure the conservation of mountain ecosystems, including their biodiversity, in order to enhance their capacity to provide benefits that are essential for sustainable development**
>
> 15.4.1 Coverage by protected areas of important sites for mountain biodiversity
>
> 15.4.2 Mountain Green Cover Index

This target is interpreted to cover research about the conservation, restoration, and management of mountain ecosystems and their biodiversity, or research about changes in these (e.g. works about increases in biodiversity, or monitoring ecosystems). It is also considered to cover research about sustainable use of ecosystem services (benefits) provided by mountain ecosystems as defined on the UN topic page for Mountains (<a id="mountains">[UN DESA, n.d.c](#f5)</a>) in the context of sustainable development.

Specifying terms for the Mountain Green Cover Index are mentioned in the SDG metadata for indicator 15.4.2 (<a id="SDGmetarep">[UN Statistics Division 2022](#f3)</a>; https://unstats.un.org/sdgs/metadata/files/Metadata-15-04-02.pdf) and terms for Coverage by protected areas in the SDG metadata for indicator 15.4.1 (<a id="SDGmetarep">[UN Statistics Division 2022](#f3)</a>; https://unstats.un.org/sdgs/metadata/files/Metadata-15-04-01.pdf).

The phrases return some articles which mention `mountain` in a name of a species (e.g. Mountain hare, Mountain zebra, Mountain tapir). Some of these articles might not be about mountains, but identifying and excluding them without losing relevant articles would be quite challenging.

This query consists of 2 phrases. Terrestrial and freshwater terms are **not** combined with the phrases 15.4.

#### Phrase 1

This phrase aims to find research about the conservation, restoration, and management of mountain ecosystems and their biodiversity, or research about changes in these (e.g. works about increases in alpine biodiversity, or monitoring mountain ecosystems). It includes research about protected areas, key biodiversity areas and vegetation covered areas of the mountains (Mountain Green Cover Index). 

Specifying terms for areas counted as green cover for the Mountain Green Cover Index `forest` `shrubs` `trees` `pasture` `cropland` `grassland` `wetland` are mentioned in the SDG metadata for indicator 15.4.2 (<a id="SDGmetarep">[UN Statistics Division 2022](#f3)</a>; https://unstats.un.org/sdgs/metadata/files/Metadata-15-04-02.pdf). `KBA` is not freely truncated due to noise from "kbar" (a unit).

Compared to the action approach, a string of action terms is added in addition to the existing management/conservation terms to reach relevant articles which do not mention conservation (e.g. about `decline` of biodiversity on mountain areas). Many of the terms for Protected areas/Natural monuments etc. are combined with ecosystem terms - the aim of this is to exclude protecting human communities, architecture etc. 

The elements of this phrase are: *(management/conservation/changes + ecosystems/bidiversity OR management/conservation/protected areas + ecosystems/bidiversity OR instruments) + mountains*.

### Target 15.5

> **15.5 Take urgent and significant action to reduce the degradation of natural habitats, halt the loss of biodiversity and, by 2020, protect and prevent the extinction of threatened species**
>
> 15.5.1 Red List Index

This target is interpreted to cover research about: 
- Degradation of terrestrial and freshwater habitats (phrase 1)
- Loss of biodiversity in these habitats (phrase 2)
- Management and conservation of biodiversity, or changes in biodiversity (phrase 3)
- Extinction of threatened species (phrase 4)

All phrases of target 15.5. are combined with **Terrestrial and freshwater terms** either with `AND` or by excluding `marine` habitats, except when a **terrestrial or freshwater term is mentioned**. Because phrases 1 and 2 consist of more general terms, they are combined to **Terrestrial and freshwater terms** with `AND`. For phrases 3 and 4, which consist of terms used primarily in ecology, exclusion of `marine` habitats (except when a terrestrial or freshwater term is mentioned) and some other terms which were detected to bring irrelevant results was found sufficient.

This query consists of 4 phrases.

#### Phrase 1

This phrase aims to find research about the degradation of terrestrial habitats. The elements of the phrase are *degratation + habitats*. In order to specify to the terrestrial and freshwater ecosystems the phrase is combined with **Terrestrial and freshwater terms** with `AND`.

```

#### Phrase 2

This phrase aims to find research about the loss of biodiversity. The elements of the phrase are *loss + biodiversity*. In order to specify to the terrestrial and freshwater ecosystems the phrase is combined with **Terrestrial and freshwater terms** with `AND`.

```py

```

#### Phrase 3

This phrase aims to find research about protecting biodiversity and threatened species. It also aims to find articles which contribute to protecting biodiversity more indirectly (e.g. articles which mention enhancing/reducing/evaluating biodiversity). 

Even though this is the topic approach version, the phrase still contains the element of action as the target is concidered to be `protecting biodiversity` not anything about biodiversity. Compared to the action approach version, in this phrase the action terms which limit the management/conservation of biodiversity (promote/restor/etc.) have been removed. The management/conservation string has not been removed to keep the topic about "protecting biodiversity". A broader string of action terms is added alongside protecting/conserving to find relevant articles which do not mention protecting (e.g. articles about enhancing/reducing/evaluating biodiversity). The relation between action terms and biodiversity is looser in this phrase than in the action approach version of the phrase (combined with `AND` instead of `NEAR`).

The concept of *threatened species* is interpreted according to the classification of the SDG metadata for indicator 15.5.1 (<a id="SDGmetarep">[UN Statistics Division 2022](#f3)</a>; https://unstats.un.org/sdgs/metadata/files/Metadata-15-05-01.pdf): 
> "Threatened species are those listed on The IUCN Red List of Threatened Species in the categories Vulnerable, Endangered, or Critically Endangered (i.e., species that are facing a high, very high, or extremely high risk of extinction in the wild in the medium-term future)."

The elements of the phrase are *action + biodiversity/key biodiversity areas/threatened species*. It is limited by the exclusion of `marine` habitats (except when a **terrestrial or freshwater term** is mentioned) and some other terms which were detected to bring irrelevant results. Terms about human microbiome and terms which are related to diseases were added to `NOT` string in order to exclude articles about those. The medical terms were picked from a set of irrelevant papers found when testing the phrases and are not chosen systematically. It is possible that terms like `parasite` `infection` or `immunology` will exclude also relevant results.

### Target 15.6

> **15.6 Promote fair and equitable sharing of the benefits arising from the utilization of genetic resources and promote appropriate access to such resources, as internationally agreed**
>
> 15.6.1 Number of countries that have adopted legislative, administrative and policy frameworks to ensure fair and equitable sharing of benefits

This target is interpreted to cover research about sharing/access/fairness/usage in relation to a) genetic resources of terrestrial and freshwater organisms/ecosystems or their benefits, or b) traditional knowledge associated with these organisms/ecosystems. (b) is wider than another possible stricter interpretation, which would only cover traditional knowledge about genetic resources; currently our string is wider, and would cover e.g. access to traditional knowledge about management of forests. 

Benefits are defined according to the CBD factsheet on Access and Benefit-Sharing (ABS) (<a id="abs">[CBD, n.d.](#f10)</a>). They range from basic research to development of products. By the definition of the CBD, benefit sharing applies also to benefits arising from the use of traditional knowledge of indigenous and local communities associated with genetic resources. *The Nagoya Protocol on Access to Genetic Resources and the Fair and Equitable Sharing of Benefits Arising from their Utilization to the Convention on Biological Diversity* is an essential agreement related to this target. CBD webpages on Nagoya protocol (<a id="nagoya">[CBD, Aug 2022](#f9)</a>) were used to define the aims and scope of this target.

In addition to papers about the use of terrestrial and freshwater resources, this query also returns some agricultural papers. They are not excluded from the results since the indicator 15.6.1 includes "Countries that are contracting Parties to the International Treaty on Plant Genetic Resources for Food and Agriculture (PGRFA)" (<a id="SDGmetarep">[UN Statistics Division 2022](#f3)</a>; https://unstats.un.org/sdgs/metadata/files/Metadata-15-06-01.pdf).

This query consists of 3 phrases. The phrases are limited by the exclusion of `marine` habitats (except when a **terrestrial or freshwater term** is mentioned) and some other terms which were detected to bring irrelevant results.

#### Phrase 1

This phrase aims to find research about sharing/access/fairness/use and genetic resources or traditional knowledge. The elements of the phrase are *sharing/access/use + resources/knowledge + ecosystems/organisms/bioresources*.

#### Phrase 3

This phrase aims to find research about the instruments/treaties/agreements for promoting benefit sharing and access to genetic resources and traditional knowledge. The action approach version of this phrase is not limited by actions (promoting or using), since works mentioning the relevant international instruments/agreements are assumed to be related to promoting this target. Therefore this phrase is identical to the action approach version of it. 

The elements of the phrase are *resources/knowledge + instruments*. It is limited by the exclusion of `marine` habitats (except when a **terrestrial or freshwater term** is mentioned) and some other terms which were detected to bring irrelevant results.

### Target 15.7

> **15.7 Take urgent action to end poaching and trafficking of protected species of flora and fauna and address both demand and supply of illegal wildlife products**
>
> 15.7.1 Proportion of traded wildlife that was poached or illicitly trafficked

This target is interpreted to cover research about poaching and trafficking of terrestrial and freshwater species. The target also covers the research about the markets or trade for illegal wildlife products. It is somewhat unclear to us whether the target aims to cover all poaching or just poaching of protected species. We have decided to include all species - in practice, many works talk about illegal trade/poaching in wildlife without specifically refering to "protected" species. 

Some particularly susceptible species were added to the phrase for better recall. The source for these was The UN's World Wildlife Crime Report (<a id="wwc">[UNODC, 2020](#f13)</a>).

This query consists of 3 phrases. The phrases are limited by the exclusion of `marine` habitats (except when a **terrestrial or freshwater term** is mentioned) and some other terms which were detected to bring irrelevant results.

#### Phrase 1

This phrase aims to find research about poaching and trafficking of species.

The elements of the phrase are *poaching/trafficking + species*. It is limited by the exclusion of marine habitats (except when a **terrestrial or freshwater term** is mentioned) and some other terms which were detected to bring irrelevant results (particularly here, `traffick*` + `animal` is problematic in cell biology without NOT terms).

```

#### Phrase 2

This phrase aims to find research about the markets/trade for illegal wildlife products. In the action approach version of this phrase no action terms are combined with the markets (reduced demand & supply). Therefore this phrase is similar to the action approach version of it, but a wider NEAR distance/AND is used.

The elements of the phrase are *species + illegal products + markets*. It is limited by the exclusion of `marine` habitats (except when a **terrestrial or freshwater term** is mentioned) and some other terms which were detected to bring irrelevant results.

```

#### Phrase 3

This phrase aims to find research about species also mentioning *The Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES)*. The elements of the phrase are *species + CITES*. It is limited by the exclusion of `marine` habitats (except when a **terrestrial or freshwater term** is mentioned) and some other terms which were detected to bring irrelevant results.

No action terms are combined with the action approach version of this phrase since it could be assumed that articles mentioning protected/endangered species and CITES are action-oriented. Hence this phrase is identical to the action approach version of it.

The phrase is quite broad and return also some articles which are more about target 15.5 (protection of threatened species) than about the trade on them. 

The term `CITES` is combined with a couple of NOT terms to try and remove "cite" as a verb. Even still, some such articles are retrived by this phrase. However, if `CITES` is combined, even with many species/animal terms, we lose many relevant works.

### Target 15.8

> **15.8 By 2020, introduce measures to prevent the introduction and significantly reduce the impact of invasive alien species on land and water ecosystems and control or eradicate the priority species**
>
> 15.8.1 Proportion of countries adopting relevant national legislation and adequately resourcing the prevention or control of invasive alien species

This target is interpreted to cover research about the introduction of alien species to terrestrial and freshwater ecosystems and about controlling and eradicating them. It also covers research about the impact of alien species. The impacts are specified as defined in the SDG metadata for indicator 15.8.1 (<a id="SDGmetarep">[UN Statistics Division 2022](#f3)</a>; https://unstats.un.org/sdgs/metadata/files/Metadata-15-08-01.pdf).

By the definition of the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD), from webpages from the CBD:
> "Invasive alien species are plants, animals, pathogens and other organisms that are non-native to an ecosystem, and which may cause economic or environmental harm or adversely affect human health" (<a id="aliens">[CBD, May 2021](#f11)</a>)

Not all alien species are invasive, and not all papers about invasive species necessarily mention the term alien. Terms `invasive` and `invasive alien` are sometimes used inconsistently. These phrases are designed to find research about preventing the introduction of any alien or invasive species to the ecosystems, and the negative impacts of them.

The phrases also return some papers about the effects of invasive species on agriculture (pests, diseases). By the CBD definition these might also be considered relevant (economic or environmental harm) even though they would not deal with the impacts on natural ecosystems.

All phrases return irrelevant medical papers (invasive disease/infection caused by a pathogen species/organism). Of the checked results for each phrase, on average 2/100 were medical. These are hard to exclude, because (by the BCD definition) relevant papers may also be about the effects invasive alien species have on human health. Hence NOT disease etc. will exclude also relevant papers.

This query consists of 3 phrases. The phrases are limited by the exclusion of `marine` habitats (except when a **terrestrial or freshwater term** is mentioned) and some other terms which were detected to bring irrelevant results.

#### Phrase 1

It is limited by the exclusion of `marine` habitats (except when a **terrestrial or freshwater term** is mentioned) and some other terms which were detected to bring irrelevant results. This string is the same as the action approach.

### Target 15.9

> **15.9 By 2020, integrate ecosystem and biodiversity values into national and local planning, development processes, poverty reduction strategies and accounts**
>
> 15.9.1 (a) Number of countries that have established national targets in accordance with or similar to Aichi Biodiversity Target 2 of the
> Strategic Plan for Biodiversity 2011â2020 in their national biodiversity strategy and action plans and the progress reported towards these targets;
> and (b) integration of biodiversity into national accounting and reporting systems, defined as implementation of the System of Environmental-Economic Accountings

This target is interpreted to cover research about national/local strategies/accounting/reporting and either a) ecosystem values/conserving ecosystems, b) conserving biodiversity, or c) the CBD Aichi Biodiversity Target 2 (CBD webpages; <a id="aichi">[CBD, Sep 2020](#f12)</a>). This covers research about national plans in context of *Aichi biodiversity targets* and *System of Environmental-Economic Accounting* which are mentioned in the SDG metadata for indicator 15.9.1 (<a id="SDGmetarep">[UN Statistics Division 2022](#f3)</a>; https://unstats.un.org/sdgs/metadata/files/Metadata-15-09-01.pdf). Biodiversity and ecosystem values are interpreted to be about protecting and conserving biodiversity and ecosystems. Even though the target specifies development processes and poverty reduction, `strategies` and `plans` in the phrases are not limited to just these. 

Articles about ecosystem and biodiversity values in national planning were assumed to be related to promoting the implementation of these. Hence, no action terms (such as promote/enable/etc.) were combined with the phrase of this target in the *action* approach, and the *topic* approach is identical.

This query consists of 1 phrase. The elements of this phrase are *NBSAPs // (Aichi/biodiversity values / conservation + ecosystem/biodiversity) + national/local + strategies*. It is limited by the exclusion of `marine` habitats (except when a **terrestrial or freshwater term** is mentioned) and some other terms which were detected to bring irrelevant results, e.g. `public health` `epidemiology` `national health` `healthcare` `health effects` `archaeology` `architecture*`. A set of medical terms about human microbiome and diseases was also added to exclude noise found in some cases when `diversity` is combined with `biological` etc. These were picked from a set of irrelevant papers found when testing the phrases and are not chosen systematically. It is possible that terms like `parasite` `infection` or `immunology` will exclude also relevant results.

While testing the phrase it was noticed that the term `environment` will bring a lot noise due to its use on various fields (business environment, cultural environment, learning environment, etc.). To exclude these, `environment` was combined with a string of species & habitat terms.

### Target 15.a

> **15.a Mobilize and significantly increase financial resources from all sources to conserve and sustainably use biodiversity and ecosystems**
>
> 15.a.1 (a) Official development assistance on conservation and sustainable use of biodiversity; and (b) revenue generated and finance mobilized from biodiversity-relevant economic instruments

This target is interpreted to cover research about financing the conservation and sustainable use of biodiversity and ecosystems. 

Financial resources include development assistance and finance mobilized from economic instruments, including incentives mentioned in the SDG metadata for indicator 15.a.1  (<a id="SDGmetarep">[UN Statistics Division 2022](#f3)</a>; https://unstats.un.org/sdgs/metadata/files/Metadata-15-0a-01.pdf) and financial instruments or capacity building initiatives mentioned in the HLPF Background note for SDG 15 (<a>[UN-DESA/DSDG et al. 2018](#f4)</a>).

We assume that all research about financial resources for conserving and sustainable use of biodiversity and ecosystem is relatively action-oriented. Hence, no additional action terms (such as increase, enhance, etc.) were combined with this query and thus this topic version is the same as the action version. 

This query consists of 1 phrase. The elements of this phrase are *protection/sustainable use + ecosystem/biodiversity + financing/instruments*. The phrase is limited by the exclusion of `marine` habitats (except when a **terrestrial or freshwater term** is mentioned) and some other terms which were detected to bring irrelevant results. A set of medical terms about human microbiome and diseases was also added to exclude noise found in some cases when `diversity` is combined with `species` etc. These were picked from a set of irrelevant papers found when testing the phrases and are not chosen systematically. It is possible that terms like `parasite` `infection` or `immunology` will exclude also relevant results.

As the use of term `ecosystem` by others than natural sciences brings irrelevant results, it was combined with a string of species and habitat terms. Terms `community` `area` and `zone` were left out from the phrase in order to exclude irrelevant results.

### Target 15.b

> **15.b Mobilize significant resources from all sources and at all levels to finance sustainable forest management and provide adequate incentives to developing countries to advance such management, including for conservation and reforestation**
>
> 15.b.1 (a) Official development assistance on conservation and sustainable use of biodiversity; and (b) revenue generated and finance mobilized from biodiversity-relevant economic instruments

This target is interpreted to cover research about financing/investments/incentives and either sustainable forest management, forest conservation or reforestation. This will cover research that considers both positive and negative effects of financing.

The elements of the phrase are *financing/incentives/instruments + sustainable use/conservation/reforestation + forests*. 

Part of the phrase (aiming for sustainable forest management) is similar to the 15.2 phrase 1, but the specified management practises are left out of the phrase to exclude results which might be less about sustainability and more about forestry as a business. Terms `planting trees` are added to this string, but not used in the strings of 15.2. In the context of this phrase these terms are likely to return relevant results. Whereas in the strings of 15.2 without the connection to incentives, they might bring noise.

### Target 15.c

> **15.c Enhance global support for efforts to combat poaching and trafficking of protected species, including by increasing the capacity of local communities to pursue sustainable livelihood opportunities**
>
> 15.c.1 Proportion of traded wildlife that was poached or illicitly trafficked

This target is interpreted to cover research about poaching and a) capacity and support (e.g. education, collaboration), or b) local communities or sustainable livelihoods. We settled on this interpretation as it covers a slightly more specific aspect than 15.7, which is more widely about combatting poaching. It is somewhat unclear to us whether the target aims to cover all poaching or just poaching of protected species. We have decided to include all species - in practice, many works talk about illegal trade/poaching in wildlife without specifically refering to "protected" species. 

Some particularly susceptible species were added to the phrases for better recall. The source for these was The UN's World Wildlife Crime Report (<a id="wwc">[UNODC, 2020](#f13)</a>).

This query consists of 2 phrases. Both phrases are limited by the exclusion of `marine` habitats (except when a **terrestrial or freshwater term** is mentioned) and some other terms which were detected to bring irrelevant results.

#### Phrase 1

The elements of the phrase are *capacity/instruments + poaching/trafficking + species*. The phrase is limited by the exclusion of `marine` habitats (except when a **terrestrial or freshwater term** is mentioned) and some other terms which were detected to bring irrelevant results (particularly here, `traffick*` + `animal` is problematic in cell biology without NOT terms).

```

#### Phrase 2

This phrase aims to find research about poaching and trafficking of species in relation to sustainable livelihood opportunities of the local communities. `CITES` is added as an alternative to poaching or trafficking of species because often the implications to the local communities follow from the application of CITES decisions (<a id="cites">[CITES & General Secretariat of the Organization of American States, 2015](#f14)</a>).

The elements of the phrase are *CITES/poaching/trafficking + species + livelihoods/local communities*. The phrase is limited by the exclusion of `marine` habitats (except when a **terrestrial or freshwater term** is mentioned).
